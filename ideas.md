# Ouro v2.5 - Development Roadmap and Ideas

## Overview

Ouro is a privacy-first, offline AI assistant powered by Ollama that runs completely on the user's hardware. The application allows users to interact with a local LLM (Large Language Model) without sending any data to external servers, ensuring complete privacy and data sovereignty. The current version (2.5) provides a basic chat interface and integration with Ollama for LLM processing.

## Current Features

- **100% Offline Operation**: All processing happens locally on the user's machine
- **Privacy-Focused**: No data sent to external servers
- **Ollama Integration**: Leverages Ollama for running LLMs locally
- **Qdrant Vector Database**: Enables RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities
- **Multi-platform**: Works on macOS, with planned support for Windows and Linux
- **User-friendly Installation**: Step-by-step installer with system compatibility checks
- **Model Selection**: Options for different size models based on hardware capabilities
- **Dark Mode UI**: Modern, clean interface

## Technical Implementation

The application is built with the following technologies:

- **Electron**: For the cross-platform desktop application framework
- **Node.js**: Backend processing
- **Python**: Server component for handling the API layer
- **Ollama**: For running LLMs locally
- **Qdrant**: Vector database for document storage and retrieval

   - Include Qdrant as part of the installation
   - Bundle all Python dependencies
   - Eliminate all network calls, even to localhost

2. **Offline Installation**
   - Complete offline installer that requires no downloads
   - Model management without internet connectivity
   - USB/external drive based updates

3. **Verification System**
   - Hash verification of all components
   - Integrity checking without online services
   - Local update validation

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive offline documentation
   - Built-in tutorials and guides
   - Troubleshooting without internet resources

## Enhanced User Experience

1. **Customization**
   - Themes and appearance customization
   - Keyboard shortcuts configuration
   - Custom prompt templates
   - Interface layout options

2. **Accessibility**
   - Screen reader support
   - Keyboard navigation improvements
   - High contrast themes
   - Font size and spacing options

3. **Onboarding**

   - Sample projects and templates
   - Guided setup process
   - Best practices documentation

## Development Approach

For developers looking to contribute or extend Ouro:

1. **Architecture**
   - The application follows a modular design with clear separation between:
     - UI layer (Electron renderer process)
     - Application logic (Electron main process)
     - AI processing (Python server with Ollama)
     - Storage (Qdrant and local file system)

2. **Contribution Guidelines**
   - Focus on privacy-preserving features
   - Maintain offline-first approach
   - Optimize for performance on consumer hardware
   - Follow secure coding practices

3. **Extension Points**
   - Model adapters for different LLM backends
   - Vector database connectors
   - UI components and themes
   - Document processors
