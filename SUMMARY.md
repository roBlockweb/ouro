   - Properly resolving resource paths in both development and production environments

2. **Enhanced Architecture**:
   - Complete rewrite of the Python web server with proper API endpoints
   - Improved error handling and logging throughout the application
   - Proper event handling for installation and progress feedback

3. **Enhanced UI/UX**:
   - Seamless integration with Ollama API
   - Fallback mechanisms when API calls fail
   - Comprehensive installer flow with system checks and model recommendations

4. **Streamlined Build Process**:
   - Simplified build scripts for various platforms
   - Proper DMG configuration for macOS distribution
   - Configuration to include all necessary resources

## Key Components

1. **Electron Main Process** (`src/main/index.js`):

   - Model selection and management
   - Real-time interaction with Ollama models

4. **Installer UI** (`src/ui/`):
   - Step-by-step installation wizard
